This repo contains all of the designs submitted to the [COVID Moonshot](https://covid.postera.ai/covid) project, as well as the initial experimental data created as part of the project.

The data has been split into many different folders and files, in order to ease the organization of such a large number of designs made through several CROs.

There exists one "master file" containing most of the non-experimental information: [covid_submissions_all_info.csv](https://github.com/mc-robinson/COVID_moonshot_submissions/blob/master/covid_submissions_all_info.csv) This file is described in much greater detail at the end of this README.

There also exist several folders:
- [data_for_CDD/](https://github.com/mc-robinson/COVID_moonshot_submissions/tree/master/data_for_CDD): prepares the data in a format suitable for upload to the CDD (Collaborative Drug Discovery) vault
- [orders/](https://github.com/mc-robinson/COVID_moonshot_submissions): The compounds that have been ordered up to this point.
- [shipments/](https://github.com/mc-robinson/COVID_moonshot_submissions/tree/master/shipments_data) the compounds that have been recevied up to this point.

Additionally, the remote [Moonshot_DR_curves](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qhhDSImiu2f-5IiI0sI5OfSTxeM8JQ2A?usp=share_link) folder contains the biochemical dose-response curves for the compounds on this project.

Some more detail on [covid_submissions_all_info.csv](https://github.com/mc-robinson/COVID_moonshot_submissions/blob/master/covid_submissions_all_info.csv), and its many fields.

This is the main file containing all of the submitted molecules. It contains quite a few fields described below:
- **SMILES**: the SMILES string as canonicalized by RDKit and standardized by https://github.com/chembl/ChEMBL_Structure_Pipeline. Note that this SMILES is the registration SMILES, but may not correspond to the actual SMILES of the compound. See the `suspected_SMILES` field of `suspected_SMILES.csv` for further info.
- **CID**: the compound ID, with the first 3 strings corresponding to the submission ID at https://covid.postera.ai/covid/submissions. 
       e.g. "MAT-POS-916a2c5a-1" is the 3rd molecule of submission "MAT-POS-916a2c5a". 
       The submission ID's are constructed as "<FIRST 3 LETTERS OF NAME>-<FIRST 3 LETTERS OF INSTITUTION>-<RANDOM 8 character string>"
- **CID (canonical)**: The canonical compound ID corresponding to the ID given when the       molecule was submitted for the first time. 
- **CID (old format)**: The CID in the old format in order to maintain backwards compatability. This format bas been deprectated.
- **PostEra Link**: the link to the associated molecule detail page on postera.ai

- **creator**: the creator of the submission. 
- **rationale**: the reasoning supplied by the creator for the molecule designs in the 
associated submission
- **Submission Notes**: Any notes supplied by the creator with the submission.

## Details on SMILES and molecule identities##

Please see `suspected_SMILES.csv`: Note that many of the enantiopure compounds on this project were obtained by chiral separation, and thus the compounds are often obtained as a single enantiomer with unknown absolute stereochemistry. The `suspected_SMILES` column represents the understanding of the actually identity of the compound given the current information, which explains the frequent use of enhanced/relative stereochemistry representations. Keep in mind that the`suspected_SMILES` is often not the same as the `registration_SMILES`, since compounds must be registered as a real (non-relatively defined) compound on this project.

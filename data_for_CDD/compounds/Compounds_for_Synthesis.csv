 Notes on the chemical profile:

Design protocol: Fragments co-crystalized with COVID-19 main protease (released by the Diamond Xchem group) served as starting 
scaffolds for combinatorial chemistry with an in-development Meiler Lab algorithm called BCL::LinkFragments. After filtering ~800,000 fragment combinations for physchem properties, geometry (i.e. pocket complementarity), and predicted activity, we performed focused library design (BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign) on a subset of the best new molecules. The variation of this algorithm 
 utilized for this study incorporated a conventional supervised feed-forward deep neural network (DNN) as a pose-dependent protein-ligand  interface scorer. Fragments were perturbed in a Monte Carlo - Metropolis fashion using alchemical transformations, and refined at each step to minimize clashes, optimize pose orientation, and filter out unstable/non-drug-like modifications. Molecules are optimized for clash resolution and interaction score. The best molecules undergo a final short run of BCL::FocusedLibraryDesign, and minor manual modifications are selectively made to intentionally increase probing of the structure-activity relationship (SAR). Finally, compounds are re-docked with RosettaLigand. The top-scoring complex is taken to be the final pose. Note that in multiple instances there is more than 1 well-populated binding pose. Here, we simply took the best scoring pose. Also note that the pose optimizing the RosettaLigand score is not the same pose that optimizes the DNN score. 

Nomenclature: XLogP, XLogS, and XdG_Hyd are LogP, LogS, and dg_hydration (kcal/mol) predictions made using a multi-tasking deep neural network trained in the BCL. LipinksiDruglike returns 1 if there are less than 2 Lipinksi violations. RS_Score_Raw and RSCONVOL_Score_Raw are two novel (in preparation) scoring functions developed in the BCL that use a DNN to prediction the binding affinity of small molecules to receptors (in units of -log(Kd)) using either pose-dependent or pose-dependent+pose-independent protein-ligand hybrid descriptors. RS_AD and RSCONVOL_AD are applicability domain (AD) metrics of the DNN scores; values less_equal 0.90 are generally considered good and mean we trust the corresponding activity prediction reasonably well. RosettaLigandInterfaceScore is the interface_delta_X (protein-ligand interaction score) from Rosetta v3.11 of the best pose in Talaris2014 Rosetta energy units (REU). MoleculeComplexity is a metric by Ertl. et al., 2009, Journal of Cheminformatics, and generally less than 2.5 indicates the molecule is reasonably synthesizable.","x0759,x1478",https://covid.postera.ai/covid/submissions/BEN-VAN-77c,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,412.44000000000017,3.3604800000000017,1,5,78.25,0,"acrylate, halo_acrylate",Michael acceptor,PASS,PASS,"terminal vinyl, alpha beta-unsaturated ketones; center of Michael reactivity",vinyl michael acceptor2,PASS,Ethene

First, a set of 2.1K existing viral protease inhibitors from ChEMBL was analyzed to extract a library of 9.4K common design motifs. Reverie’s in-house fragment expansion engine was used to combinatorially place these fragments on the acetamide methyl position of fragment X0107 via a variety of simple, synthetically-accessible linkers. Results were filtered extensively for toxicity and reactivity using an in-house library of SMARTS patterns, and an RDKit cLogP cutoff of 5.0 was applied. The remaining 8.4K compounds were docked via multiple docking methods and pose-constrained to match the orientation of the crystal-bound X0107 fragment.

With this aim, we took from e-Drug3D (https://chemoinfo.ipmc.cnrs.fr/MOLDB/index.php) all the 1930 molecular structures approved between 1939 and 2019 by the FDA with a molecular weight ≤ 2000 Da and docked them at the binding site of 6LU7 structure by using three different docking programs (i.e., GlideSP, FRED and VINA). For each ligand and docking program, we have kept the top 10 docked poses (i.e., 10 for GlideSP, 10 for FRED and 10 for VINA). When considering 10 poses per ligand/program we assume that one of them will be the bioactive one (although the score function not always have ranked it as the first one). Finally the bioactive pose is assumed to be identified if it has been found simultaneously by the three programs (this means that the rmsd for each pairwise pose comparison is below 1.5 angstroms). Our idea here is that, in general, protein-ligand docking programs are really good when trying to look for the possible poses of a ligand in a binding site but usually fail to rank correctly such poses. Then, if three different protein-ligand programs find the same pose, this have a high probability to be the bioactive one.

Then, we applied a second filter in order to keep only those poses that are not only identified by the three programs but also show high affinity for M-pro. In order to find which threshold can be used to discriminate high from low affinity poses, we docked the 1577 compounds from the OTAVA Machine Learning SARS Targeted Library (https://otavachemicals.com/targets/sars-cov-2-targeted-libraries?utm_medium=email&utm_source=UniSender&utm_campaign=229613803) into the binding site of 6LU7 with GlideSP, FRED and VINA (with the identical set up conditions than were previously used for the 1930 FDA approved compounds). For this docking, we kept only the top-ranked pose obtained for each ligand by each programs. Then, we make three different histograms for the docking results of the OTAVA library (one per program) and arbitrarily selected as a threshold for distinguish from low to high M-pro affinity the lowest score value of the interval that contains the top 30% poses with the highest affinity. The resulting threshold was -6.3 for GlideSP, -7.0 for FRED and -7.5 for VINA. Then, all the poses that had succeed the first filter but had scores more positive than these threshold values were removed.

Then, only 5 FDA approved compounds simultaneously accomplished that: (1) the same pose is found independently by GlideSP, FRED and VINA; and (2) this pose has score values equal or more negative than the three mentioned thresholds.

An acrylamide warhead was preferred over the chloroacetamide to reduce the reactivity of the electrophile. Fragment x1382 was modified by incorporating an acrylamide instead of the original warhead, and docked with CovDock-LO (Schrödinger, https://doi.org/10.1021/ci500118s) against Cys145 to obtain reference coordinates for warhead atoms. A library of ≈450k acrylamides was compiled from the Enamine REAL database. An Interaction Fingerprint (IFP) analysis on XChem hits highlighted four recurring ph4 features: an hydrophobic group in P2; an H-bond donor to E166-O; an H-bond acceptor to E166-N; an H-bond acceptor to H163-NE2. The hydrophobic feature in P2 was found to be the most frequent and was set as mandatory together with at least one of the three H-bond features for the constrained docking with rDock. Tethered and constrained HTVS by rDock was performed by allowing rotational and translational degree of freedom to a certain extent for warhead atoms in the reactive site. Dynamic Undocking (DUck, https://doi.org/10.1038/nchem.2660) was performed focusing on the H-bond established by best scoring rDock hits with any of the three ph4 residues. CovDock-LO was performed on the best scoring hits to obtain covalent docking poses. For the sake of computational time, this first series of compounds comes from the application of DUckCov only on the best scoring hits by rDock.

We have additionally assessed affinities of these 12 compounds to the SARS-CoV-2 main protease outer surface because we have recently found, that high affinity to the protein surface can significantly affect ligands activities toward proteins with open active sites [our manuscript is currently under consideration in Chemical Science]. We have found, that these compounds (CP-5 and CP-7 in the original work) have very low affinities to the protein surface, which makes them the best performers using the method we developed for targets with open active sites.

2) searched  PDB for related enzymes and PDBbind for potent ligands binding to these enzymes
3) shortlisted  4YoJ, inhibitor is with 0.4 uM one of the most potent inhibitors for related enzymes, synthesis appears to be pretty straight forward (Targeting zoonotic viruses: Structure-based inhibition of the 3C-like protease from bat coronavirus HKU4—The likely reservoir host to the human coronavirus that causes Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), Sarah E.St. JohnabcSakshiTomaracShaun R.StaufferdeAndrew D.Mesecarabc )
4) The core (amid bond) of the ligand in 4YOJ also superimposes very well with  X_0434 and X_0678
5) P1 is occupied by benzotriazol in 4YOJ, should also fit in Mpro
6) pyridine (found in X_0107, X_0434, X_0678) should also fit in this pocket
7) X_0995 has a pyrimidine, but this can not easily be attached to the core
8) other heterocycles which have an acceptor group overlapping with the nitrogen atom in X_0107 could also be explored
9) P2-P4 pocket is occupied with a thiophenyl group in 4YOJ
10) this area is not well explored by the fragments. The fragments that bind there don't have a vector that could be joined with the core of the ligand in 4YOJ
10) based on synthetic route described in the paper mentioned above, Enamine building block library was searched for in stock compounds which have an aldehyde group directly attached to an aromatic ring => 429 this
11) Used RDkit to replace the part of the ligand in 4YOJ that goes into this subpocket and docked the resulting compounds into the X_0107 binding site using FlexX, used parts of ligand in 4YOJ as template, rescoring was done with Hyde
12) This pocket is very tight and only three reasonable hits very obtained (predicted affinity low micromolar, N-methyl-pyrol, Fluro-thiophen, Fluro-furan)
13) other five-membered rings could also be explored
14) P2-P1' pocket is rather hydrophobic, X_1334, X_1412, X_1385, X_1380, X_1336, X_0774, but the vectors in these fragments are not suited to link them with the core of the ligand in 4YOJ
15) searched Enamine building blocks library for aromatic and aliphatic amines which are in stock => 549 hits
16) Used RDkit to replace the part of the ligand in 4YOJ that goes into this subpocket and docked the resulting compounds  into the X_0107 binding site using FlexX, used parts of ligand in 4YOJ as template, rescoring was done with Hyde
17) as expected, many hydrophobic substituents scored well, some hits were selected based on visual exception

Based on these results, I suggest to
1) synthesize and test the ligand that is contained in 4YOJ

To enable this, we used Cyclica’s Ligand Design™  (LD), a flexible machine learning for identifying molecules that best satisfy a defined objective function. Briefly, LD traverses a chemical space iteratively by repeatedly deriving new molecules (children) from previous selections (parents) and then filtering them with respect to one or more objective functions. This optimization process proceeds until convergence, when no better molecules can be found. Ligand Design has multiple options for traversing chemical space, including fixed library screening (10^6 molecules evaluated), rule-based semi-generative approaches (~10^10 molecules represented), and fully generative options (~10^120 molecule possibilities). Importantly, for this design challenge, we used the semi-generative option for LD (that was developed with support from our Partners at Enamine), which efficiently traverses the Enamine REAL Space of molecules to identify promising molecules with high synthetic accessibility. 

For this design challenge, we applied two major selective pressures (objective functions). The first optimizes for compatibility with the 3CLpro binding site using Cyclica’s MatchMaker Deep Learning proteome-screening engine (white paper here: https://tinyurl.com/wx3yg64). MatchMaker has been found to be far more accurate than molecular docking, and is also several orders of magnitude more computationally efficient. The second is a ligand-based model consisting of all active fragments coming from the XChem screen. This model was created using our POEM technology (https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.04555), a parameter-free supervised learning algorithm that utilizes multiple fingerprints simultaneously for improved predictive performance. Incorporation of this POEM model pressures LD to evolve molecules which resemble the fragment set (and prioritizes the molecules with higher occupancy in the crystal structures). Additional filters ensure that all molecules evaluated have ‘drug-like’ physicochemical properties and exclude problematic functional groups.  

Cyclica’s Ligand Design was applied using default parameters, allowing the optimization to proceed until convergence. The resulting process automatically defined a total of 106 ‘top molecules’ on the basis of proteome screening ranks. Among these top molecules, 35 ranked the corona virus protease compatibility higher than any human protein (~8000 present in the screen). A semi-manual curation process was applied to the 106 to prioritize molecules for submission. The first three were selected on the basis of having substructures with exact matches to hits from the XChem fragment screen. Next, we clustered the remaining top molecules using a multiple fingerprint approach and selected the 10 cluster exemplars for a total of 13 submissions. Any positive hits among cluster exemplars would merit subsequent investigation of the remaining cluster members.  

Note, For this submission Cyclica’s Ligand Design was used in its default state with no algorithmic customization or further optimizations to strictly enforce the presence of select fragments. We are open to further customizing this LD design process in subsequent design iterations, in order to incorporate the the expert insights of medicinal chemists involved in this project.","x0072,x0161,x0995",https://covid.postera.ai/covid/submissions/VIJ-CYC-1a3,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,304.3900000000001,3.0745000000000013,2,3,67.43,0,"acrylate, halo_acrylate",Michael acceptor,PASS,PASS,"carbamate, T-boc Protected, carbamate include di-substitued N, terminal vinyl, alpha beta-unsaturated ketones; center of Michael reactivity","Long aliphatic chain, vinyl michael acceptor2",PASS,Ethene

Importantly, for this design challenge, we used the semi-generative option for LD (that was developed with support from our Partners at Enamine), which efficiently traverses the Enamine REAL Space of molecules to identify promising molecules with high synthetic accessibility. 

For this design challenge, we applied two major selective pressures (objective functions). The first optimizes for compatibility with the 3CLpro binding site using Cyclica’s MatchMaker Deep Learning proteome-screening engine (white paper here: https://tinyurl.com/wx3yg64). MatchMaker has been found to be far more accurate than molecular docking, and is also several orders of magnitude more computationally efficient. The second is a ligand-based model consisting of all active fragments coming from the XChem screen. This model was created using our POEM technology (https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.04555), a parameter-free supervised learning algorithm that utilizes multiple fingerprints simultaneously for improved predictive performance. Incorporation of this POEM model pressures LD to evolve molecules which resemble the fragment set (and prioritizes the molecules with higher occupancy in the crystal structures). Additional filters ensure that all molecules evaluated have ‘drug-like’ physicochemical properties and exclude problematic functional groups.  

Cyclica’s Ligand Design was applied using default parameters, allowing the optimization to proceed until convergence. The resulting process automatically defined a total of 106 ‘top molecules’ on the basis of proteome screening ranks. Among these top molecules, 35 ranked the corona virus protease compatibility higher than any human protein (~8000 present in the screen). A semi-manual curation process was applied to the 106 to prioritize molecules for submission. The first three were selected on the basis of having substructures with exact matches to hits from the XChem fragment screen. Next, we clustered the remaining top molecules using a multiple fingerprint approach and selected the 10 cluster exemplars for a total of 13 submissions. Any positive hits among cluster exemplars would merit subsequent investigation of the remaining cluster members.  

Note, For this submission Cyclica’s Ligand Design was used in its default state with no algorithmic customization or further optimizations to strictly enforce the presence of select fragments. We are open to further customizing this LD design process in subsequent design iterations, in order to incorporate the the expert insights of medicinal chemists involved in this project.","x0072,x0161,x0995",https://covid.postera.ai/covid/submissions/VIJ-CYC-1a3,Z3294574183,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,270.32899999999995,1.98258,1,3,69.96000000000001,0,cyanohydrin,PASS,PASS,PASS,N-C-Hal or cyano methyl,Hetero_hetero,PASS,PASS
